# Problem 1

This problem is about prevention of drug prescription that could cause patient allergy. This laboratory test done in the hospital tp revent such event is called Enzyme-linked immunospot. However, sometime the test could lead to false negative as patient do not response to the test or other factors.
Therefore, we want to solve this problem by developing prediction model prescription of allergic drug.

# Problem 3

This is a image classification problem where we want to classify whether the image was taken either from Wat Po or Wat Prakeaw. This task is very challenging as both are temple which contain many similar objects. However, there are some objects that are unique to one of the places. To solve this problem, I'm going to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the image. I'm build my own CNN model and also use RESNET to leverage the method of transfer learning where there might be some low level feature that might benefit for classification.

The trained model wasn't uploaded because of file sizes are too large.
